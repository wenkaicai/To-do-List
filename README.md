# To-do List Project

## About the project

This project is a To-do List Java application which aims to help the user organize their time more leisurely. 
This application provides user access such as editing and updating the information for their tasks in their To-do list. 

This project is designed for everybody, and it's primarily aimed towards pretty busy people, who always have a lot of 
tasks need to finish in their daily lives. Like we all have those days when there are a million things to do, and we 
don't know how we're going to get it all done. It's easy to become overwhelmed by the vast quantity of tasks we must do
 daily. It will be much easier to use a to-do list to manage your task and control your time.

## Why I Wanted to Build It

I love To Do lists and make them almost every day. I can definitely say that on the days when I am being most 
productive, I am following a To Do list. There are many benefits of To Do lists, from helping you prioritize your time 
to helping you remember what it is you meant to do! For me, to do lists are absolutely invaluable. Itâ€™s a very simple 
strategy that works great!
